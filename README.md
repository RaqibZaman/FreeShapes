# FreeShapes
My project for Learning C# WPF .NET
The idea is to make free form shapes with these requirements:
 * 1. Open an image file within your application.
 * 2. Draw a free shape over the image using mouse clicks.
 * 3. Change the free shape by moving its different edges (connections between lines).
 * 4. Change the color of the shape by clicking on it and selecting a different color from a color palette.
 * 5. Drag/drop the shape to change its location.
 * 6. Select the shape and be able to delete it.
 * 7. Save the image file.
 * (opt.) The user can open the image using your application and update the shapes that were drawn in a previous session.
 * (better) Add error handling
